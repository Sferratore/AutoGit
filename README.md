## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Fork the repository
Create a fork of this repository on your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the repository locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AutoGit.git
cd AutoGit
```

### 3. Create and activate the virtual environment with Pipenv
If you don't have `pipenv` yet, install it:
```bash
pip install pipenv
```
Then install the project dependencies:
```bash
pipenv install
```
> This command reads `Pipfile.lock` and recreates the environment with the correct versions.

**Notes:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: must be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with **Read/Write** permissions on the repository.
- `AUTOGIT_REPO_PATH`: path to the local repository folder (you can leave `./` if the `.env` file is in the repo root).
